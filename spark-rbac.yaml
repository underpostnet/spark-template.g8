# This file defines the necessary Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
# resources for the Spark driver pod to operate within the Kubernetes cluster.
# The driver needs permissions to create and manage its executor pods.

# 1. ServiceAccount: An identity for the Spark driver pods.
# Your SparkApplication manifest refers to this by name.
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: spark
  namespace: default

# 2. Role: A set of permissions within the 'default' namespace.
# This grants the ability to manage pods and services, which the driver needs for its executors.

# 3. RoleBinding: Connects the 'spark' ServiceAccount to the 'spark-role' Role.
# This is what actually grants the permissions to the service account.
