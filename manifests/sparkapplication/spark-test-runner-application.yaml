  # The location of your application JAR inside the Docker container.
  # When running in a container, often just the JAR name is sufficient if it's
  # in a standard classpath location. The 'local://' scheme is crucial
  # to tell Spark the file is already in the image.

  # building and pushing it to a registry (like Docker Hub, GCR, ECR, etc.).
